%% The "Acknowledgement" section can be given in all manuscript
%% classes.  This should be given within the "acknowledgement"
%% environment, which will make the correct section or running title.

\begin{acknowledgement}

Please use ``The authors thank \ldots'' rather than ``The

\begin{suppinfo}

This will usually read something like: ``Experimental procedures and
characterization data for all new compounds.
