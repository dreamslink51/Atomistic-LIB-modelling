\section{Outlook (Jacqueline)}
In this review, we have introduced the key methods deployed in battery modelling at the atomistic scale and summarised progress in this field, covering models for all the components of a battery. Notable developments in atomistic methods for batteries include the semi-grand canonical framework developed by \citeauthor{VanderVen2020}, expansion of the ONETEP code to link up with kinetic Monte Carlo, the inclusion of entropy effects by parameterising a phase field model from Monte Carlo calculations, development of more accurate force field potentials and the use of HPC to parallelise and speed up Monte Carlo calculations.


\begin{itemize}

    \item Materials design for improved capacity, rate capability, stability. Mentioned in all 3 sections. For example, edge doping and morphology tuning of graphite, silicides, excess Li cathodes
    
    \item Path dependency and connectivity of phase space: hysteresis (difference between charge and discharge behaviour) is a universal challenge for anodes and cathodes, and the role of metastable behaviour is an outstanding challenge. This results in challenges in comparing experimentally observable behaviour like the OCV with equilibrium potentials, for example.
    
    \item Heterogeneities: point defects can be done, grain boundaries challenging - mentioned in cathodes and solid electrolytes.
    
    \item \textbf{Interfaces}: mentioned in anodes (Superior models of surface and interface effects are needed which deal with the complex nature of the SEI; systematic modifications to the edge morphology or the use of dopants on the graphite edge \cite{peng2020lithium,weydanz1994behavior,way1994effect} or tuning of the interlayer carbon spacing \cite{JI201866} to enable systematically tuning of the rate performance), lattice mismatch in solid state batteries, briefly mentioned in cathodes (CEI). could be mentioned last as possibly to biggest frontier; Multi-scale modelling approaches have been shown to be strong tools to develop novel nanostructures and composites, understand the dynamics and phase behaviour and develop novel interfaces to accommodate volume expansion.
    
    \item A universal framework to understand degradation is still missing, but atomistic models can help to understand particular aspects and develop more robust materials
    
    \item Linking atomistic modelling to continuum and control models and/or experiment. - experimental and continuum link mentioned in anodes, control link mentioned in anodes. (experiment might need to be separate)

\end{itemize}
